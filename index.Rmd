This is the Slidify portion of the class Project.

I chose to attempt to use the lyrics to identify the genre of songs

--- 

The project took the lyrics of 1383 songs from various locations, including:

- http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407

- http://www.stereogum.com/24391/vh1s_100_greatest_hiphop_songs-2/list/

- http://tasteofcountry.com/top-100-country-songs/

(amongst others)

Then downloaded the lyrics from the api at http://www.chartlyrics.com/api.aspx

--- 

A number of "standard" words were identified and filtered out:

```{r echo=FALSE}
filterOut <- c("a", "about", "after", "all", "also", "an", "and", "another", "any", "are",
               "as", "at", "be", "because", "been", "before", "being", "between", "both", 
               "but", "by", "came", "can", "come", "could", "did", "do", "does", "each", 
               "else", "for", "from", "get", "got", "had", "has", "have", "he","his","her","hers",
               "here", "how", "we","ll","my","s","m","n","t","d",
               "i","if", "in", "into", "is", "it", "its", "just", "like", "me", "make", "many", 
               "might", "of", "on", "only", "or", "other", "our", "out", "over", "re", "same", 
               "should", "since", "so", "some", "still", "such", "take", "than", "that", "the", 
               "then", "there", "these", "they", "them", "this", "those", "through", "to", "too", "up", "use", 
               "way", "well", "went", "were", "what", "when", "where", "which", "while", "will", "wont",
               "baby","back","cause","don","down","ever","every","go","gonna","good","hey","him","know",
               "let","love","no","not","now","oh","one","said","say","she","thing","ve","was","yeah",
               "again","ain","am","around","away","day","everybody"
               ,"feel","keep","life","little","long","look","man","never"
               ,"night","ooh","right","see","time","want","who","woman","yes",
               "with", "would", "you","your")
filterOut
```

Then through extensive data cleansing, identified the top 40 words from each genre and chose 72 total from them identifying words per genre, and then applied a random forest, which isn't very accurate at all.
